name: Staging - Build PR

# **What it does**: Builds PRs before deploying them.
# **Why we have it**: Because it's not safe to share our deploy secrets with forked repos: https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
# **Who does it impact**: All contributors.

  # This is necessary so that the cached things can be reused between
  # pull requests.
  # If we don't let the workflow run on `main` the caching will only
  # help between multiple runs of the same workflow. By letting
  # it build on pushes to main too, the cache will be reusable
  # in other people's PRs too.
